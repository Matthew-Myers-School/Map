I included a separate test file with my project because between 451, 440 and a ton of poor time management I was short on time and didnâ€™t fit it into the test.cpp

iterator and const iterator functions work, 
find, insert, erase, size work in the correct times
map is set at 32 levels, with an infinite amount of entries
I store the data as a Key_T variable and a Value_T variable, rather than a pair, so it most likely cannot be compared directly to a normal map
